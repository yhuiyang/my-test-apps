This file describes how to build this application.

Required Tool or Library
========================
1. DialogBlocks for your platform:
   We use this tool to generate build rule files for each platform.
   Ex: Makefile for Linux; Solution/Project file for Windows.
2. Cross-platform GUI framework, wxWidgets for your platform:
   We use version 2.9.1, you need version >= 2.9.1.
   You can download, compile you own wxWidgets libraries, or you can
   use other pre-build wxWidgets too. It's up to you.
3. Poedit for your platform:
   We use this tool to generate the mo language files from po files.
4. SubWCRev.exe (Windows platform only):
   This is a tool shipped with TortoiseSVN. We use it to generate some
   working copy info and integrate the info into this application.
   
Build Procedure
===============
1. Build your wxWidgets libraries, we need at least the unicode debug and
   unicode release build. If you use pre-build distribution, you can skip
   this step. In any case, you need to know the exact path to you wxWidgets.
2. Use DialogBlocks to open the project file (*.pjd), and select menu
   [Build/Generate Makefile] to generate the build rule files for your
   platform. After files are genrated, you can close DialogBlocks.
3. Start from the platform build rule files to build your application.
